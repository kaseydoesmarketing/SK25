## Frequently Asked Questions

### Billing & Pricing

**Q: Can I cancel anytime?**
A: Yes, absolutely. Cancel your Pro subscription anytime with one click. Your Pro features remain active until the end of your billing period, then you automatically return to the Free tier.

**Q: Do you offer student discounts?**  
A: Yes! Students get 50% off SKTCH Pro with valid .edu email verification. That's just $6/month for unlimited premium features.

**Q: What happens if I exceed 60 minutes on the Free tier?**
A: SKTCH simply stops transcribing until your next monthly reset. No charges, no locked features - just a gentle reminder to consider upgrading for unlimited access.

**Q: Is there a long-term contract for Enterprise?**
A: No. Enterprise plans are month-to-month with volume discounts for annual commitments. We believe in earning your business every month.

### Features & Functionality

**Q: How much faster is the Pro Voice Filter?**
A: Pro users get <250ms latency compared to 300-400ms on the free tier. That's 40% faster response time, making voice input feel as instant as typing.

**Q: Can I try Pro features before paying?**
A: Yes! Every new user gets a 14-day Pro trial with full access to all premium features. No credit card required until you decide to continue.

**Q: Do Flow Modes really make a difference?**
A: Absolutely. Users report 60% fewer edits needed when SKTCH automatically formats for their specific use case - emails, AI prompts, or task lists.

### Technical & Security

**Q: Will Pro features work offline?**
A: Basic transcription works offline. Pro Voice Filter and Context-aware Flow Modes require internet for AI processing, but we cache common patterns for limited offline functionality.

**Q: How do you justify the pricing vs. free alternatives?**
A: Free solutions typically have 92% accuracy, high latency, and no intelligent formatting. SKTCH Pro delivers 99.2% accuracy, <250ms speed, and context-aware enhancement - the difference between a rough transcript and polished communication.
