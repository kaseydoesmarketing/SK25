Hi [First Name],

I hope you've had a chance to try SKTCH! I'm reaching out with three power-user tips that our most productive users swear by:

üí° TIP #1: THE FLOW MODE SECRET
Did you know SKTCH automatically optimizes your text based on context?
- Writing emails? ‚Üí Professional tone and formatting
- Using ChatGPT? ‚Üí Clear, AI-friendly prompts  
- Taking notes? ‚Üí Perfect punctuation and structure

Try this: Use SKTCH in Gmail vs. ChatGPT and notice how it adapts!

üí° TIP #2: VOICE COMMANDS FOR EDITING
You don't need to touch your keyboard for corrections:
- Say "period" or "comma" for punctuation
- Say "new line" or "new paragraph" for formatting
- Say "delete that" to remove the last phrase
- Say "capitalize" to fix capitalization

üí° TIP #3: THE WALKING MEETING HACK
Our CEO drafts entire blog posts while walking her dog using SKTCH + Google Docs. The secret? Natural speech works better than trying to "dictate formally."

Just speak like you're explaining to a friend - SKTCH handles the rest.

[Try These Tips Now]

Used up your 60 minutes already? Here's what Pro users get:
‚úÖ Unlimited transcription
‚úÖ Pro Voice Filter (removes "ums", polishes grammar)

### Email 3: Success Stories (Send 5 days after signup)

**Subject Line:** "How Marcus saved 15 hours/week with SKTCH"

**Content:**
```
Hi [First Name],

I love hearing how SKTCH transforms people's workflows. Here's a story from Marcus, a product manager in San Francisco:

"I was skeptical about voice tools - tried Dragon years ago and hated it. But SKTCH is different.

I now dictate all my emails during my morning commute (I take the train). By the time I get to the office, my inbox is cleared and I'm ready for deep work.

Last week I calculated the time savings: 15+ hours per week that I used to spend typing. That's 60+ hours per month back in my life."

üéØ MARCUS'S SETUP:
‚Ä¢ Uses SKTCH Pro for unlimited transcription
‚Ä¢ Dictates emails, Slack messages, and Notion docs
‚Ä¢ Pro Voice Filter makes everything sound professional
‚Ä¢ Saved 780+ hours last year (that's 4.5 months of full-time work!)

What could you do with 15 extra hours per week?

The best part? Marcus started with the same free account you have. He upgraded to Pro after hitting the 60-minute limit on day 3.

### Email 4: Common Questions (Send 7 days after signup)

**Subject Line:** "Your top 5 SKTCH questions answered"

**Content:**
```
Hi [First Name],

After helping thousands of users get started with SKTCH, I've noticed the same questions come up repeatedly. Let me address the top 5:

‚ùì "Will people hear my voice dictation in the office?"
SKTCH works great with whisper-level speech. Many users dictate quietly at their desk without anyone noticing. Pro tip: Use a headset mic for even better privacy.

‚ùì "Does it work with [specific website/app]?"
SKTCH works on 10,000+ websites including all major platforms: Gmail, Slack, Notion, ChatGPT, LinkedIn, Facebook, and virtually any website with text inputs. If it doesn't work somewhere, email me directly!

‚ùì "What's the difference between free and Pro?"
Free gives you 60 minutes monthly with basic accuracy. Pro gives you unlimited usage, Pro Voice Filter (removes "ums", polishes grammar), 3x faster speed, and advanced features. Most users upgrade within a week.

‚ùì "Is my voice data private?"
Absolutely. We process simple commands locally on your computer. Complex speech uses encrypted cloud processing and is never stored. We're SOC 2 certified and GDPR compliant.

‚ùì "How accurate is it really?"
Free users get 95% accuracy. Pro users get 99.2% accuracy with the Pro Voice Filter. For comparison, the industry average is 92%.

**Content:**
```
Hi [First Name],

You've been using SKTCH for over a week now - that's awesome! I'm curious: have you hit the 60-minute monthly limit yet?

Here's what I'm seeing from users like you:
‚Ä¢ 67% hit the limit within their first two weeks

Before: "Um, so like, we should probably, you know, schedule a meeting for next Tuesday."
After: "We should schedule a meeting for next Tuesday."

‚ö° 3X FASTER PROCESSING  
<250ms response time vs. 300-400ms on free. Voice input feels as instant as typing.

üéØ CONTEXT-AWARE INTELLIGENCE
Flow Modes automatically optimize formatting for emails vs. AI prompts vs. notes.

Want to try everything Pro offers? I'll give you 14 days completely free:

### Email 6: Social Proof & FOMO (Send 12 days after signup)

**Subject Line:** "While you were away, Sarah M. saved 12 hours with SKTCH Pro"

**Content:**
```
Hi [First Name],

I wanted to share something exciting that happened this week.

Sarah M., a content creator from Austin, sent me this message:

"Sarah, I upgraded to SKTCH Pro on Monday. It's Friday now and I've already saved 12 hours of typing time. I'm writing this email while walking around my neighborhood - something I never could do before. This tool is magic."

She's not alone. This week:

üìä SKTCH COMMUNITY HIGHLIGHTS:
‚Ä¢ Marcus R. dictated 47 emails during his commute
‚Ä¢ Dr. Foster transcribed 8 hours of research notes hands-free  
‚Ä¢ Team at StartupCo processed 200+ support tickets using voice
‚Ä¢ Jennifer L. wrote her entire novel chapter while doing dishes

The common thread? They all use SKTCH Pro.

Here's what you're missing with the free version:
‚ùå Only 60 minutes/month (Pro users average 8+ hours)
‚ùå Slower processing (300-400ms vs <250ms with Pro)
‚ùå No Pro Voice Filter (misses the grammar polishing magic)
‚ùå Basic accuracy (95% vs 99.2% with Pro)

Ready to join the Pro community?

[Upgrade to Pro - First 14 Days Free]

Still on the fence? Here's what happened when I asked our Pro users "Would you recommend SKTCH Pro to a friend?"
‚Ä¢ 96% said "Absolutely yes"
‚Ä¢ 4% said "Yes"  
‚Ä¢ 0% said "No"

That's a 100% recommendation rate.

Your move,
Sarah

P.S. Pro users get priority support too. I respond to Pro users within 4 hours vs. 24-48 hours for free users.

Hi [First Name],

You're halfway through your SKTCH Pro trial! Perfect timing to share what's possible when you fully embrace voice-first workflows.

Meet Jennifer, a freelance marketing consultant:

"I was drowning in client work - 12+ hours daily just to keep up. Typing was my bottleneck.

SKTCH Pro changed everything. Now I:
‚Ä¢ Dictate client proposals while walking my dog
‚Ä¢ Voice-draft social media content during lunch breaks  
‚Ä¢ Create email campaigns during my commute
‚Ä¢ Brainstorm strategies while doing dishes

I reclaimed 20+ hours weekly. That's 80+ hours per month back in my life. I took a vacation for the first time in two years!"

üéØ JENNIFER'S PRO SETUP:
‚Ä¢ Uses Flow Modes for different client contexts
‚Ä¢ Pro Voice Filter ensures everything sounds professional
‚Ä¢ Unlimited transcription lets her work anywhere, anytime
‚Ä¢ Advanced voice commands for rapid editing

Her secret? She stopped trying to find time to type and started creating content during "dead time" instead.

What could you do with 20 extra hours per week?

### Email 6: Final Follow-up (Send 30 days after inquiry)

**Subject Line:** "Last check-in: SKTCH Enterprise opportunity for [Company Name]"

**Content:**
```
Hi [First Name],

This is my final follow-up on your SKTCH Enterprise inquiry. I respect that you have many priorities competing for your attention.

Before I close this out, I wanted to leave you with one final thought:

The companies that are thriving in 2025 aren't necessarily the biggest or best-funded. They're the ones that adopt productivity-multiplying technologies first.

Voice-first workflows are inevitable. The question isn't whether your organization will adopt them - it's whether you'll be leading the transformation or catching up to competitors who moved first.

üéØ WHAT YOUR PEERS ARE DOING:

**Law Firms:** 34% have deployed enterprise voice solutions
**Healthcare Systems:** 42% using voice for documentation  
**Financial Services:** 28% implementing voice workflows
**Technology Companies:** 56% have voice-first policies

The early adopters aren't just saving time - they're attracting top talent, improving accessibility, and building competitive advantages.

IF THIS OPPORTUNITY STILL INTERESTS YOU:
‚Ä¢ Reply to this email with "Yes, let's talk"
‚Ä¢ I'll schedule a no-pressure conversation
‚Ä¢ We'll explore whether SKTCH Enterprise makes sense
‚Ä¢ If not, I'll point you toward other solutions

NO PRESSURE EITHER WAY:
If SKTCH Enterprise isn't right for [Company Name] right now, that's perfectly fine. I'll remove you from follow-up emails and wish you the best.

Thank you for considering SKTCH. Whatever you decide, I hope you find the productivity solution that transforms your organization.

Final offer expires Friday,
Michael Thompson
Enterprise Solutions Director
